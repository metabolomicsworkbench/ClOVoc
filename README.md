# ClOVoc
Clinical Observations and Vocabularies
ClOVoc (Clinical Observations and Vocabularies) is a partnership module between Metabolomics Workbench (MW), Kids First (KF), and Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions (SPARC). They aim to enhance and demonstrate the FAIRness of clinical studies across KF and MW using SPARC's knowledge graph to enable integrated analysis. The details of the proposal, its implementation and associated resources can be found in the white paper: ClOVoc_WhitePaper.
